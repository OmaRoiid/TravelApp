# Time to Travel
# Project Five - Travel App (Front End Developer Udacity Nanodegree)

## Project Objective
To build a travel application that contains a simple form which obtains information on user's upcoming trip - destination and departure date. With the help of external APIs - Geonames, Dark Sky and Pixabay, the app then displays weather and an image of the location on that given date. This is project #5 - part of my Udacity Front-End Development Nanodegree.



## Get Up and Running
- ```npm install```
- ```npm start``` to start the app
run in development mode
- ``` npm run build-dev``` to start the app
- this app runs on localhost:8080, but you can of course edit that in index.js
